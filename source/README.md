**Open Files**

This plugin shows any open files on the array that might prevent a clean shutdown.  The plugin web page is installed in 'Tools'.  An 'Open Files' tab is installed at 'Main->Open Files' that will alert you of any open files preventing a shutdown of the array.  You can interactively kill processes that are holding files open.
